# White Board Exercises
This is a collection of all in-class exercises, quizzes, and white board exercises completed while attending the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA). This repository focuses almost exclusively on C# exercises, but MSSA students also learn ASP.NET and MVC, as well as SQL.
